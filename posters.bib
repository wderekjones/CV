  abstract  = "The cost of bringing a drug to market depends on how quickly a
               candidate drug can be ``discovered'' and evaluated to ensure
               safety and effectiveness. In this work we develop a method for
               predicting whether a given drug and protein compound will
               ``bind.'' Our aim is to select a set of features to predict
               drug-protein interactions. This study focuses on kinases. Kinase
               inhibitors are the largest class of new cancer therapies.
               Selective inhibition is difficult due to high sequence
               similarity, leading to off-target interactions and side-effects.
